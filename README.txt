Welcome to the commit_viewer wiki!

The main goal of this Application is to list the commit history of any public GitHub repository.
For that, the user will need to provide the GitHub URL for the repository he wants to see the commit list.

    4. [exit] - Ends Application

In order to use it, you will need to follow this steps:
 
    1. You need to have the latest version of Node.js installed
    2. Clone the repository
    3. Step into the project's directory(e.g. 'cd commit_viewer', if you're using the terminal console)
